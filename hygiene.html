2. Food storage: Store food at the correct temperature to prevent the growth of bacteria. Follow the storage instructions on the food label.<br>



3. Separation: Keep raw meat, poultry, fish, and eggs separate from ready-to-eat foods to prevent cross-contamination.<br>



4. Proper cooking: Cook food at the appropriate temperature to destroy bacteria. Check the internal temperature of the food with a thermometer to ensure it is safe to eat.<br>



5. Food handling: Ensure that food is handled properly to avoid cross-contamination. For example; avoid touching ready-to-eat foods with hands that have touched raw meat.<br>



6. Quality control: Only use fresh, wholesome ingredients and discard food that is expired or past its use-by date.<br>



7. Personal hygiene: Practice good personal hygiene, including washing hands regularly and keeping hair tied back.<br>

  <h2><li>Hand wash</li></h2>

<p>Hand wash is a simple yet vital hygiene practice that involves cleansing the hands to remove dirt, germs, and other harmful microorganisms. It typically involves using soap, water, and friction to thoroughly clean the hands. Hand washing is essential for preventing the spread of infectious diseases, as many illnesses are transmitted through contact with contaminated hands. Proper hand washing involves wetting the hands, applying soap, lathering and scrubbing all surfaces of the hands (including fingers, nails, and wrists) for at least 20 seconds, rinsing off the soap under running water, and drying the hands using a clean towel or air dryer. Hand washing should be done regularly, especially before eating, after using the restroom, after coughing or sneezing, and after being in public spaces to maintain good personal hygiene and reduce the risk of infections.
